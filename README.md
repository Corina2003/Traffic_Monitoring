# Traffic_Monitoring
I have implemented a system that effectively manages traffic and provides virtual information to drivers. This system allows drivers to report traffic incidents, which are then shared with all traffic participants. Each car automatically transmits its speed data to the system. Based on this information, the system notifies drivers about specific speed restrictions, often due to traffic congestion. Additionally, drivers have the option to subscribe and receive updates about weather conditions, sporting events, and fuel prices at gas stations. This project has enhanced the efficiency and safety of driving by keeping drivers well-informed in real-time.
